      <h1>The Left Wing Case for Churchill</h1>

  <p><em>Published December 26, 2025</em></p>

  <p>When governments “reiterate their support for international law,” it usually means international law has just been quietly set aside. The Prime Minister’s response yesterday to the capture of Nicolás Maduro follows this familiar pattern.</p>
 
  <p>But law that binds only when convenient is not law at all — more like etiquette, or a kind of secular incense waved to sanctify outcomes already decided. Diplomatically, it may be our best option. But legally we are walking a tightrope.</p>
 
  <p>The legal problem is not obscure. Under the UN Charter, the forcible seizure of a foreign head of state on sovereign territory without Security Council authorisation constitutes a violation of Article 2(4). This is not controversial among serious international lawyers. The UK knows this.</p>
 
  <p>So the PM’s statement attempts a manoeuvre. The alternatives are deemed worse. Acknowledging international law violation and supporting it anyway would undermine the UK’s entire rules-based posture to Ukraine, Taiwan, Gaza, etc. Acknowledging international law violation and opposing it breaks with the US at a critical moment.</p>
 
  <p>So the statement splits the difference. Endorse the fall of Maduro, gesture toward legality and defer judgement to the future. The problem is this triangle is inherently unstable and could potentially undermine our diplomatic efforts elsewhere.</p>
 
  <p>Take the UK’s own positions on Ukraine and Taiwan, where our foreign-policy credibility in both cases rests on the insistence that borders, sovereignty and leaders cannot be altered by force. The PM’s statement punctures our credibility.</p>
 
  <p>The UK’s argument for Ukraine is that Russia violated Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. Force cannot be justified by historical grievance, claims of illegitimacy or protection of the people. Ends do not justify the means.</p>
 
  <p>In Venezuala, the UK has now implicitly accepted forcible removal of a head of state without UN authorisation, justified by alleged illegitimacy and humanitarian claims. This hands Moscow a ready-made rebuttal whereby western nations decree sovereignty absolute unless we happen to dislike the government.</p>
 
  <p>Even though the cases differ morally, international law is not precedent-sensitive to moral sympathy. With the PM’s latest statement, the UK has weakened its ability to argue that law, rather than alignment, governs its outrage.</p>
 
  <p>The UK’s position on Taiwan is that the status quo must not be altered by force. Disputes must be resolved peacefully and legitimacy cannot be imposed militarily. With the Venezuela precedent, the UK now tacitly endorses regime change without territorial annexation, justified by claims of popular will and enforced externally.</p>
 
  <p>Beijing’s reply writes itself: ‘We are not annexing – we are restoring legitimate governance.’ The UK relies heavily on norms, not formal recognition, to defend Taiwan. Norm erosion here is especially costly.</p>
 
  <p>So what does the PM’s statement actually say? The key sentence is the most revealing one:</p>
 
  <p style="margin-left: 4em;">
      'The UK has long supported a transition of power in Venezuela.
  </p>
 
  <p>This is doing a lot of work. The PM is signalling that this is not a reaction to events but a continuation of a settled UK position, dating back to the UK recognition of Juan Guaidó. This matters domestically since it allows Starmer to avoid charges of opportunism or incoherence.</p>
 
  <p>'We shed no tears’ signals to allies like Washington and European partners that Britain remains aligned and is not going wobbly. It also signals to markets and diplomatic actors that no surprise realignment is coming.</p>
 
  <p>Note however that when paired with ‘I reiterated my support for international law’, ‘We shed no tears’ becomes classic British diplomatic hedging. The outcome is morally approved of, but procedural anxiety is expressed about the method. The UK is saying we like the destination, but we reserve the right to question the route.</p>
 
  <p>By stressing ‘The UK government will discuss the evolving situation with US counterparts’, Labour avoids owning the intervention as well as endorsing every U.S. action and committing to military or material involvement. This is support without fingerprints.</p>
 
  <p>The deeper strategic logic is that the UK has little to lose by endorsing his removal but much to lose by breaking with the U.S. over it. Venezuela under Maduro had become economically marginal, politically isolated and strategically aligned with Russia, Iran and China. So the statement reflects cost-benefit realism, not ideological enthusiasm.</p>
 
  <p>What the statement carefully avoids saying is equally important. There is no explicit endorsement of the means of capture. No claim that the intervention was legal. No blanket approval of regime change. And No commitment to recognise any successor immediately.</p>
 
  <p>Instead, Labour inserts the phrase ‘a safe and peaceful transition.’ That’s diplomatic code for we reserve the right to distance ourselves if this turns ugly.</p>
 
  <p>The language in the PM’s statement is not new though. It has a lineage.</p>
 
  <p>In 1989, Noriega was forcibly removed from power in Panama on the justification of criminal indictment for drug trafficking. The argument was once again the restoration of democracy, making this the closest analogue to Venezuela – and it was widely regarded as illegal.</p>
 
  <p>In reality, the head of state was captured by U.S. forces while the UN General Assembly condemned the invasion. The precedent was quietly shelved, not repudiated.</p>
 
  <p>In 1999, Blair had a go in Kosovo. This time, the justification was humanitarian emergency. The UK acknowledged the lack of UN authorisation and claimed legitimacy beyond international law. The moral necessity of our intervention required that law bend to conscience. But once you detach morality from legality, you create a doctrine usable by anyone.</p>
 
  <p>This was most evident in Iraq in 2003 where legal interpretation was treated as authorisation. Asserted necessity and implied legality led to ambiguity which corroded trust faster than outright law-breaking.</p>
 
  <p>The pattern each time looked like this:</p>
 
  <p style="margin-left: 4em;">
      1.     UK endoses outcome.
      2.     Gestures at law.
      3.     Defers reckoning
      4.     Absorbs long-term reputational cost.
  </p>
 
  <p>It is concerning that Venezuela fits this pattern. How many more chances do we have to bounce back from reputational damage?</p>
 
  <p>That trade-off may seem tolerable now, but it is exactly the trade-off that makes future appeals to law sound hollow when the next crisis arrives.</p>
 
  <p>We’re already hearing arguments to the effect that Maduro was illegitimate so sovereignty didn’t apply. This is politically common, but legally weak. International law does not condition sovereignty democratic legitimacy. Governments are recognised based on effective control, not moral worth. The UK has recognised many governments it considers morally illegitimate.</p>
 
  <p>Arguments that this was law enforcement fail because law enforcement requires jurisdiction and jurisdiction requires consent or treaty. None exists here. Nor can it be called humanitarian intervention because that requires imminent mass atrocity, proportionality and collective authorisation. Removing a leader to enable future democracy does not qualify.</p>
